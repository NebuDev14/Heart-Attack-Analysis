```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list=ls()) 
library(ggplot2)
heart_data <- read.csv("heart.csv", header = TRUE)
```

This data is from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset
```{r}
summary(heart_data)
```

Does gender have an effect on heart rate?
```{r}
male <- subset(heart_data, sex == 1)
female <- subset(heart_data, sex == 0)
```

```{r}
mean(male$thalachh, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(female$thalachh, na.rm = TRUE)

```

What about chances on a heart attack?
```{r}
length(which(male$output == 1))
length(which(female$output == 1))
```

Does age have an affect on the chance of a heart attack?
```{r}
more_likely <- subset(heart_data, output == 1)
less_likely <- subset(heart_data, output == 0)
```

Find the average age for both subsets
```{r}
mean(more_likely$age, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(less_likely$age, na.rm = TRUE)
```
